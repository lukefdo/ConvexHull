# ConvexHull
School Project in CS228 Iowa State

To run program, open Eclipse and add the ConvexHull folder to your workspace. Once inside your workspace, open the Plot Class and run the program. In the console press the number 1 and push enter, the program will then ask you to enter in a number which represents the random number of points that will be plotted on a x/y axis. The program will then plot those points and create a convvex hull using two different approaches. The amount of time for each approach will be given along with the actual plot of points with the convex hull drawn.
